summary: An introduction to this blog.

Hi! My name is Rohit Awate and this is an introductory post for my new blog. You can learn more about me and my work in the 'about' section and my portfolio.

I will be writing about code, technology, films, television and business; not necessarily in that order! I'm gonna try to cover slightly advanced topics that most people don't cover such as interpreters, bytecode virtual machines, protocols, containers, databases, operating systems or some complex algorithms like image/video compression. I am inquisitive and love to build things from scratch for the sake of understanding them. Thus, I might do series wherein we build something from the above from scratch: either here or on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTfwYT5Rb4EIoDGf9kjsjbQ).

I keep learning and building a lot of stuff. Hence, apart from writing tutorial series, this blog is an effort in documenting and sharing my work. This helps me learn better since I have the added responsibility of properly delivering it to the world. **Albert Einstein**'s popular quote comes to mind:

> If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.

Also, I'm hoping the stuff I write is unique and helpful to people like me who love to learn by doing.

_Stay tuned for more!_
