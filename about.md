## Hi! I am Rohit.

I'm a final year undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the University of Pune. I'm also a Microsoft Student Partner. I write about computer science, technology, films, television and business.

## Computer Science & Technology

I was always interested in technology but never thought about making it my profession. I was happy being a spectator: watching tech YouTubers, Apple and Surface keynotes and trying to convince my friends how Windows Phone was ahead of its time.

This changed in 2015 when I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my decade-old PC with the hopes of reviving it. It completely changed my perspective towards computers! Soon after, I started learning programming on my own. With just a few lines of Java to my credit, I felt empowered. That's when I decided to take up Computer Engineering as my undergraduate course. It completely changed my life.

I quickly realized that I always had an innate intuition for computers. For example, I heavily used Google's Picasa back in the day, especially it's excellent collage feature. You give it any amount of pictures and it fit them perfectly into an image of any size whilst preserving the individual aspect ratios with minimum cropping. I used to wonder how they did it so well. Anticlimactically, I still don't have a definite answer for that, but it looks like an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). I'll duly add this to my _very long_ list of pending project ideas.

Writing code has enabled to me do another thing I love: _building things!_ I've built loads of projects over the past three years and you can check out some of the noteworthy ones in my [portfolio](/portfolio). I typically work with Java, Go, Python, C/C++ and Node.js. My areas of interest and research are computer vision, compilers, distributed systems, data science and protocols.

## Films and Television
I consider myself a cinephile. In my opinion, cinema is the most powerful artistic medium. Sitting in a theater for a couple of hours, watching some beautiful imagery in tandem with Earth-shattering sound all in service of immersing you in a story? Just the thought of it puts a smile on my face.

My choice is usually on the darker, grittier and realistic side of things. As such, I am a devout fan of filmmaker Christopher Nolan. I also highly admire the works of Quentin Tarantino, David Fincher, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese and many more contemporary filmmakers.

I also enjoy watching television shows. Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Office, Big Little Lies, True Detective and Friends are some of my favorites.

_Along with code, this is one topic that I can talk endlessly about!_

Funnily enough, I was also on TV once. I was among the top 5 finalists on MTV's "Get a Job: Season 5" in 2019. I was selected from over 15,000 applications across India and interviewed with Microsoft for an internship position. I didn't get it, but the experience was beyond my wildest dreams!

## Business
No, I'm not an MBA but I am quite fascinated by the business side of technology. I love to watch how technology is affected by or itself affects acquisitions, rivalries, startups, investments, legal wars, IPOs and the like. I was a proud Windows Phone user and have seen how a phenomenal piece of technology loses in the real world thanks to some poor business decisions.

These days, I'm interested in the privacy debate and the brewing war between streaming services. It's going to be interesting to see their ramifications in the near future.

If you find any of this interesting, don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact). I'm always up for a conversation about these topics!
