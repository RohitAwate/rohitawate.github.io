## Hi! I am Rohit.

I'm 21 and I study Computer Engineering from the University of Pune. I write about code, technology, films, television and business.

## Code
I love to code and build things. I usually work with Java, C++, Go, C, Python and Node.js. I am interested in, learn about and work on desktop/web apps, protocols, tools and utilities, interpreters, servers and bytecode virtual machines. I wish to learn about data science, game engines, databases, and operating systems.

> I love what I do and have a huge appetite for this stuff.

## Technology
Reading and watching videos about technology got me interested in coding in the first place. I was hooked onto Linux the moment I installed Ubuntu on my decade-old PC in 2015. I love the field of computer science and the possibilities that await excite me. I keep up to date with the interesting new products and happenings in the industry and am always up for a conversation!

## Films and Television
I love quality entertainment. My choice is usually on the darker, grittier and realistic side of things. As such, I am a devout fan of filmmaker Christopher Nolan. I also highly admire the works of Quentin Tarantino, David Fincher, Stanley Kubrick, Peter Jackson, Martin Scorsese and many more contemporary filmmakers.

I also enjoy and have the highest level of appreciation for good television. Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, The Office, True Detective, Fargo and Friends are some of my favorites.

_Along with code, this is one topic that I can talk endlessly about!_


Funnily enough, I was also on TV once. I was among the top 5 finalists on MTV's "Get a Job: Season 5" in 2019. I was selected from over 15,000 applications across India and interviewed with Microsoft for an internship position. I didn't get it, but the experience was beyond my wildest dreams!

You can watch my episode on Viacom's streaming service, [Voot](https://www.voot.com/shows/linkedin-mtv-get-a-job-s05/5/794752/interns-in-it-to-win-it-/802875).

## Business
No, I'm not an MBA but I am quite fascinated by the business side of technology. I love to watch how technology is affected by acquisitions, rivalries, startups, investments, legal wars, IPOs and the like. I was a Windows Phone user and have seen how a phenomenal piece of technology loses in the real world thanks to some poor business decisions.
