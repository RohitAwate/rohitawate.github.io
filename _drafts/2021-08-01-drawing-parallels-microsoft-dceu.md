The past decade has been an uphill battle for both Microsoft and the DC Extended Universe. The former was struggling to stay relevant in the mobile space dominated by Google's Android and Apple's iOS while its legacy Windows PC business was in a steady decline. The latter was _(and is still)_ trying to imitate the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe by making films based on its rich portfolio of iconic characters.

I've been a DC fan for a long time, thanks to Christopher Nolan's _The Dark Knight Trilogy_ and was a proud Windows Phone user with my Nokia Lumia 630. Around 2014-2016, I have seen these two old giants fight against the new, disrputive forces around the same time. I have a soft spot for the underdog, and as Microsoft and DC were shoved into this role, I desperately wanted them to do well **because I believed they had something unique to offer. Also, monopolies suck.**

As I witnessed these battles unfold, I couldn't help but notice a similarity. Both are huge, household names, having made a massive impact on society and culture. However, they were faced with their fate due to largely the same factors. Let's talk about them today.

# Late to the Party
Smartphones exploded in popularity in 2007 with the launch of the original iPhone. Android launched in 2008 with the HTC Dream. **Windows Phone launched in October 2010.**

Marvel's Cinematic Universe had its inception in 2008 with the Robert Downey Jr. starrer _Iron Man_. The audiences loved it with its quirky, quick-witted hero and the overall light-hearted tone. It followed with six more films, successfully introducing relatively unknown characters before DC's _Man of Steel_, flew into theatres **in 2013**.

# Rocky Start
Within the first couple of years since their inception, Android and iOS gained a significant headstart in the hot new smartphone market. Consumers and developers were attracted alike; the platforms and devices opened up a whole new world of possibilities.

> [TODO: This feels a bit abrupt. Maybe add a paragraph before] By the time Windows Phone came to market, it was foreign, weird and didn't have a vibrant app ecosystem.

On the DC side, despite having a highly established character, _Man of Steel_ received a lukewarm response thanks to its un-charismatic protagonist, the dark tone of the film and the excessive, nauseating destruction wreaked throughout the film.

> By the time DC's universe came into existence, it was dark, characterless and unfunny.

iOS, Android and the MCU were huge, innovative forces when they first showed up. They offered something hitherto unseen and thereby carved out a category of their own. People quickly embraced them because they loved the fresh take on something they had been seeing for years. The cultural impact of these first movers was huge and Microsoft and DC simply couldn't cope up, even with their long legacies and deep pockets.

# Relying on the Power of Legacy
Speaking of long legacies, Microsoft and DC hoped that theirs would help them set up their mega plans and compete, but it ended up hurting them.

Microsoft tried leveraging their Windows brand to carve out a space for themselves in the smartphone business. They took a radically different approach to both Windows on the desktop and Windows Phone with the _Live Tiles_ [TODO: Add picture] interface. However, Windows 8 was met with an overwhelmingly negative response from consumers. This hurt Windows Phone as well. These products were an odd mix of a familiar brand wrapped in a foreign package.

Moving to superheroes, Warner Bros. and DC hoped that they would be able to bootstrap the DCEU off the fresh success of Christopher Nolan's _The Dark Knight Trilogy_. Plus, they had been making Batman and Superman movies since decades. They had a massive suite of IP to push out: Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash and the like. They already had the table set for them, _or did they_? Thankfully, Nolan knew better and bailed, limiting himself to executive roles for Snyder's flicks.

The failure of these projects is a good lesson in leveraging resources properly. Microsoft's and DC's efforts appear to be of _brute-force_ nature. They poured money, time and energy into these projects, hoping they would turn out well.

> While they had seemingly everything it takes to succeed, they lacked the most pivotal ingredient: **VISION**

[Add some more stuff here related to above quote and paragraph]

Additionally, these are also cases for _brand fatigue_. [TODO: Add reference]
- _"I've watched Batman and Superman in films for decades. But this Marvel stuff is new and fresh!"_
- 4 different actors have played Batman in the past decade. (I'm counting Will Arnett from the LEGO Batman movies as well.)
- _"There's a new Suicide Squad movie coming out? Already?! Didn't that shitty one come out just 4-5 years ago?"_
- _"I've used Windows forever. Literally everywhere I go, it's there. Am I now supposed to use this on my phone as well? This Android and iOS stuff looks interesting though."_
- _"Am I still supposed to be excited for the next incremental update to Windows?"_

Your brand may not necessarily be stale, but fatigue is real and consumers will explore fresh and new options.

# Saturated Markets

# Challenging the _status quo_
In my opinion, the Metro interface [TODO: add link] from Windows Phone made perfect sense. The big, colorful tiles displayed all the latest updates from your apps. Actionable items such as search bars, menus, buttons were stationed at the bottom of the screen so you didn't have to stretch your finger to the top of the screen. Funnily enough, we now see elements from Windows Phone's design in modern iterations of iOS and Android. [TODO: add reference]
