The past few years have been an uphill battle for both Microsoft and the DC Extended Universe. The former was struggling to stay relevant in the mobile space dominated by Google's Android and Apple's iOS while its legacy Windows PC business was in a steady decline. The latter was _(and is still)_ trying to imitate the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe by making films based on its rich portfolio of iconic characters.

I have been a DC fan for a long time, thanks to Christopher Nolan's _The Dark Knight Trilogy_ and was a proud Windows Phone user with my Nokia Lumia 630. I have seen these two old giants fight against the new, disrputive forces around the same time. I have a soft spot for the underdog, and as Microsoft and DC were shoved into this role, I desperately wanted them to do well **because I believed they had something unique to offer, and well, monopolies suck.**

As I witnessed these battles unfold, I couldn't help but notice a similarity. Both are huge, household namess having made a massive impact on society and culture; but they were faced with their fate due to all the same factors:

- late to the party
- lack of public interest
- relying on their legacy
- saturated markets
- challenging the _status quo_

Let's go through these one by one:

# Late to the Party
Smartphones exploded in popularity in 2007 with the launch of the original iPhone. Android launched in 2008 with the HTC Dream. **Windows Phone launched in October 2010.**

During these couple of years, Android and iOS gained a significant headstart in the hot new market. Consumers and developers were attracted alike; the platforms and devices opened up a whole new world of possibilities.

> By the time Windows Phone came to market, it was foreign, weird and didn't have a vibrant app ecosystem.

Marvel's Cinematic Universe had its inception in 2008 with the Robert Downey Jr. starrer _Iron Man_. The audiences loved it with its quirky, quick-witted hero and the overall light-hearted tone. It followed with six more films, successfully introducing relatively unknown characters before DC's _Man of Steel (2013)_, flew into theatres. Despite having a highly established character, _Man of Steel_ received a lukewarm response thanks to its un-charismatic protagonist, the _literally_ dark tone of the film and the excessive, nauseating destruction wreaked throughout the film.

> By the time DC's universe came into existence, it was dark, characterless and not funny.

iOS, Android and the MCU were huge, innovative forces. They offered something hitherto unseen and thereby carved out a category of their own. People quickly embraced them because they loved the fresh take on something they had been seeing for years. The cultural impact of these first movers was huge and Microsoft and DC simply couldn't cope up, even with their long legacies and deep pockets.
