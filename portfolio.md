## CopperVM

CopperVM is an experimental bytecode virtual machine for an opinionated subset of JavaScript, written in modern C++. It will feature a complete JavaScript runtime with an async task queue, event loop and async task thread pool.

Initially, my goal was to just build a virtual machine. Halfway through the project though, the idea that this would be able to run just JavaScript started seeming really boring. So, I decided to design my own programming language and build a brand new virtual machine using what I learned from Copper. So, that's coming up soon!

Everest made it to [#2 on GitHub Java Trending](/images/portfolio/everest_rank2.jpg) for a week, consequently pushing me to [#13](/images/portfolio/rohit_rank13.jpg) on the list of trending Java developers the same week. It is also being by the University of California at San Diego for an online course they offer as an example for learning how to navigate a codebase, find things, add new features, etc. Check out a video by the course instructor, June Clarke, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BzOA3sCD8Q).
